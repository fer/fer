## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **fer**, another human being stuck to screens since 1988.

I develop stuff sometimes. This is the philosophy I usually follow:

1. Plan ahead, but don't implement for the future,
2. If it isn't broken, don't fix it.
3. Dead/commented code is zombie code and will always infect the system.

Hereby I take some of [my notes on GitBook](https://ferx.gitbook.io/wiki/). 

> If you see an error or something that could be better, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/fer/fer/issues/new) or [create a PR](https://github.com/fer/fer/compare) on [my GitHub.](https://github.com/fer)
