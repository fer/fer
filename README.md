## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **fer**, another human being stuck to screens since 1988.

I develop stuff sometimes and I normally this is the philosophy I follow:

1. Plan ahead, but don't implement for the future,
2. If it isn't broken, don't fix it.
3. Dead/commented code is zombie code and will always infect your the system.

Here by I take some of [my notes](notes).
