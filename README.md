# ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm **fer**, another human being glued to screens since 1988.

I develop stuff sometimes. This is the philosophy I usually follow:

1. Plan ahead, but don't implement for the future,
2. If it isn't broken, don't fix it.
3. Dead/commented code is zombie code and will always infect the system.
