## 2. Cyber Kill Chain Concepts







## 3. Hacking Concepts

### What

* Exploiting vulnerabilities and compromising security controls To gain unathorized or inappropiate access to system's resources.
* Modifying a system or application features to achieve a goal outside of the creator's original purpose.
* Steal and distribute intellectual property, leading to business loss.

### Who

1. An Intelligent individual with **excellent computer skills** who can create and explore computer software and hardware.
2. **Hobbyst** probing how many computers or networks they can compromise.
3. Someone who wants to gain knowledge or to **probe and do illegal things**.

Someone with malicious intent such as to steal business data, credit card information, social security numbers, email passwords and other sensitive data.

### Classes

* **Black Hats**: Individuals with extraordinary computer skills, they resort to malicious or disruptive activities and are also known as crackers.
* **White Hats**: They used their professed hacking skills for defensive purposes are also known as security analyst; they have permission from the system owner.
* **Grey Hats**: offensively and defenisvey at times.
* **Suicide**: aim to bring down the critical infrastructure for a "cause" and are not worried about facing jail terms or any other kind of punishment.
* **Script Kiddies**: unskilled hacker who compromises a system by running scripts, tools and software that were developed by real hackers.
* **Cyber Terrorists**: wide range of skills, motivated by religious or political beliefs to create fear through the large-scale disruption of computer networks.
* **State-Sponsored Hackers**: emplyed by the government to penetrate and gain top-secret info from and do damage to the info system of other governments.
* **Hacktivist**: they promote a political agenda by hacking, especially by defacing or disabling websites.

### The 5 stages of the hacking cycle

#### \(1/5\) Reconnaisance

* Preparatory phase where an attacker seeks to gather information about a target prior to launching an attack.
* This information could be the future point of return, noted for ease of entry for an attack, when more about the target is known on a broad scale.
* Target range may include the target's organization's clients, employees, operations, network and systems.

Types

* **Passive**: Involves acquiring information without directly interacting with the target, as searching public records or news releases.
* **Active**: Involves directly interacting with the target by any means, as telephone calls to the target's help desk or tech department.

#### \(2/5\) Scanning

* **Pre-attack Phase**: pre-attack pahse when the attacker scans the network for specific information based on information gathered during reconnaisance.
* **Port Scanner**: scanning can include the use of dialers, port scanners, netowrk mappers, ping tools and vulnerability scanners.
* **Extract Information**: attackers extract information such as live machines, port, port status, OS details, device type and system uptime to launch attack.

#### \(3/5\) Gaining Access

1. It refers to the point where the attacker obtains access to the _operating system or applications_ on the target computer or network.
2. The attacker can gain access to the operating system, application or network levels.
3. The attacker can escalate privileges to obtain complete control of the system. in this process the target's connected intermediate systems are also compromised.
4. Example: Password cracking, buffer overflow, denial of service and session hijacking.

#### \(4/5\) Maintaining Access

Attackers can revisit the system at will.

* Attacker tries to retain their ownership of the system.
* Attacker prevents the system from being owned by other attackers by securing their exclusive access with backdoors, rootkits or trojans.
* Attackers can upload, download, manipulate data, applications and configurations on the owned system.
* Attackers can use the compromised system to launch further attacks.

#### \(5/5\) Clearing Tracks

Attackers always cover their tracks to hide their identity.

* Activities carried out by an attacker to hide malicious acts.
* Continue accessing to the victim's system, remaining unnoticed and uncaught and deleting evidence that might lead to their prosecution.
* The eye doctor overwrites the server, system and application logs to avoid suspicion.

## 4. Ethical Hacking Concepts

* It involves the use of tools, tricks and techniques to identify vulnerabilities and ensure system security.
* Simulating the techniques used by attackers to verify the existence of exploitable vulnerabilities in the system's security.
* Perform security assessments for an organization with the permission of concern authorities.

### Why is it necessary?

To beat a hacker you need to think like one.

* Allows for counter attacks against malicious attackers through anticipating the methods used to break into the system.
* Prevent hackers from gaining access to the organization's information systems.
* Uncover vulnerabilities in systems and explore their potential as a security risk.
* To analyze and strengthen an organization's security posture, including policies, network protection infrastructure and end-user practices.
* To provide adequate preventive measures in order to avoid security breaches.
* To help safeguard customer data.
* To enhance security awareness at out levels in a business.

### Questions to answer by an Ethical Hacker

What can I do with the system? What can I see? Is anybody watching?

1. what can an intruder see on the target system? \(reconnaissance and scanning phases\)
2. what can an intruder do with information? \(gaining access and maintaining access phases\)
3. does anyone at the target organization notice the intruders' attempts or successes? \(reconnaissance and covering tracks phases\)
4. Are all components of the information system adequeately protected, updated and patched?
5. How much time, effort and money are required to obtain adequate protection?
6. Are the information security measures in compliance with legal and industry standards?

### Scope And Limitations

We come, we assess, we report, we recommend, but we don't fix anything.

Scope:

* Ethical hacking is a crucial component of risk assessment, auditing, counter fraud and information system security best practices.
* it is used to identify risk and highlight remedial actions. 

Limitations:

* Unless the business already know what they are looking for and why they are hiring an outside vendor in to hack systems in first place, chances are there wouldn't be much to gain from experience.
* An ethical hacker can only help the organization to better understand its security system, it's up to the organization to place the right safeguards on the network.

### Skills of an Ethical Hacker

1. Technical Skills
2. In-depth knowledge of major operating environments.
3. In-depth knowledge of networking concepts, technologies and related hw & sw.
4. Computer expert.
5. Security areas & related issues.
6. High technical knowledge for launching sophisticated attacks.
7. Non-Technicall Skills
8. Ability to elarn.
9. Strong work ethics.
10. Good problem solving.
11. Communication skills.
12. Committed to the organization's security policies.
13. Aware of local standars and laws.

## 5. Information Security Controls

### Information Assurance \(IA\)

* IA refers to the assurance that the _integrity_, _availability_, _confidentiality_ and _authenticity_ of information and information systems is protected during the **usage, processing, storage and transmission of the information**.

Some of the processes that help in achieving IA include:

1. Developing local policy, process and guidance.
2. Designing network and user authentication strategies.
3. Identifying network vulnerabilities and threats.
4. Identifying problem and resource requirements.
5. Creating plans for identified resource requirements.
6. Applying appropriate information assurance controls.
7. Performing certification and accreditation.
8. Providing information assurance training.

### Defense In-Depth

You never ever rely on one level of security.

* It's a security strategy in which _several protection layers_ are placed through an information system.
* It helps to prevent direct attacks against the system and its data because a break in one layer only leads the attacker to the next layer.

From outer to inner: 1. Policies, procedures and awareness. 2. Physical. 3. Perimeter. 4. Internal Network. 5. Host. 6. Application. 7. Data

### What is Risk?

* Degree of _uncertainty_ or expectation that an adverse event may cause damage to the system.
* Categorized into different levels according to their estimated impact on the system.
* A risk matrix is used to scale risk by considering the _probability_, _likelihood_ and _consequence of impact_ of the risk.
* It's not a function of the Ethical Hacker, but we need to have a global understanding about what risk is. We are reducing the risk for a customer, we are mitigating risk. 
* We'll look at vulnerability scoring systems valuing risk.

#### Risk Management

* Process of producing and maintaining risk at an acceptable level.
* Tool: actively security program.

**Phases**

* _risk identification_: identifies the sources, causes, consequences and other details of the internal/external risks affecting the security of the organization.
* _risk assessment_: assesses the organization's risk and provides an estimate of the likelihood and impact of the risk.
* _risk treatment_: selects and implements appropriate controls for the identified risks.
* _risk tracking_: ensures appropriate controls are implemented to handle known risks and calculates the chances of a new risk ocurring.
* _risk review_: evaluates the performance of the implemented risk managemente strategies.

What do we have? How bad is it? What we can do about it? How do we ensure this doesn't happen again? Is it still happenning?

#### Cyber Threat Intelligence \(CTI\)

* It is defined as the collection and analysis of information about threats and adversaries and the drawing of patterns that provide the ability to make knowledgeable decisions for preparedness, prevention and response actions against various cyber-attacks.
* It helps the organization to identify and mitigate various business risks by converting unknown threats into known threats.
* It helps in implementing various advanced and proactive defense strategies.

Types:

* Long-term use:
  * High-Level:
    * **Strategic**: high level information on changing risks. Consumed by high level executives and management.
  * Low-level:
    * **Tactical**: Information on attacker's TTPs. Consumed by IT Service and SOC Managers, Administrators.
* Short-term/immediate use:
  * High-level:
    * **Operational**: information on a specific incoming atack. Consumed by Security Managers and Network Defenders.
  * Low-level:
    * **Technical**: Information on specific indicators of compromise. Consumed by SOC Staff and IR Teams.

#### Threat Modeling

Risk assessment approach for analyzing the security of an application by capturing, organizaing and analyzing all the information that affects the security of an application.

1. Identify security objectives: Help to determine how much _effort needs to be put_ towards subsequent steps.
2. Application overview: Identify the _components,data flows_ and trust boundaries.
3. Decompose the application: help to find more relevant and more _detailed threats_.
4. Identify threats: Eyedentify threats relevant to the _control_ scenario and context using the information obtained in steps 2 and 3.
5. Identify vulnerabilities: _Identify weaknesses_ related to the threats found using _vulnerability categories_.

#### Incident Management

Incident management is a set of defined processes to identify, analyze, prioritize and resolve security incidents to restore normal services operations as quickly as possible and prevent future recurrence of the incident.

1. Vulnerability Handling
2. Artifact Handling
3. Announcements
4. Alerts
5. Incident Handling
   1. Triage
   2. Reporting and Detection
   3. Incident Response

Steps involved in the IH&R process:

1. Preparation
2. Incident Recording and Assignment
3. Incident Triage
4. Notification
5. Containment
6. Evidence Gathering and Forensic Analysis

#### Role of AI and ML in Cyber Security

* ML and AI are now vastly used across various industries and applications due to the increase in computer power, data collection and storage capabilities.
* ML is an unsupervised self-learning system that is used to define what the normal network looks like, along with its devices and then to backtrack and report any deviations and anomalies in real-time.
* AI and ML in cybersecurity helps in identifying new exploits and weaknesses, which can then be easily analyzed to mitigate further attacks.
* The cyber security market is to exceed $300billion by 2024 and the AI-related cyber security is predicted to reach a value of $38.2 billion by 2026.
* According to [CB Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com), alongside overall rising investment activity, many cybersecurity companies are emerging to offer novel solutions to cyber threats by leveraging the advantages of AI.
* Cybersecurity is the fourth most active industry that deals with companies applying AI.

ML classification techniques:

* **Supervised learning**: makes use of agorithms that input a _set of labeled training data_, with the aim of learning the differences between the labels.
  * Classification
  * Regression
* **Unsupervised learning**: makes use of algorithms that input _unlabeled training data_, with the aim of deducing all categories by itself.
  * Dimensionality Reduction
  * Clustering
