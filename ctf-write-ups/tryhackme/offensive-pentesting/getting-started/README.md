# Getting Started

Lets get started with a few easy rooms which will give you practice in the following areas:

* Active Reconnaissance 
* Vulnerability Scanning 
* Privilege Escalation 
* Web Application Attacks 

Its important to take notes when attacking machines, as you will usually be required to explain the vulnerabilities to both a technical and non technical audience. To get practice, why not take notes or write a blog post for each room you complete?
