# Metasploit & Ruby

## Installation and Fundamentals

> Ruby is a dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. Elegant syntax, natural to read and easy to write.

* Use Ruby as a multi-paradigm language that supports a functional style of programming.
* You can use high order programming methodology and lambda calculus.

### Installation

* Comes preinstalled with Kali.
* Use [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/) for Windows.

### Getting started

#### Ruby from the command line

```text
c:\Ruby193>ruby -e "puts 'Hello friend'"
```

#### Interactive Ruby

Classic default prompt prints more information than the simple one:

```text
c:\Ruby193>irb --simple-prompt
```

#### Check Ruby interpreter

```bash
$ which ruby
/usr/bin/ruby
```

So use in your scripts `#!/usr/bin/ruby` as a shebang.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/ruby

puts 'Hi!'
```

For Windows machines, the easiest way to perform the same task is to associate the Ruby files using the Ruby installer.

### The Power of Ruby

We'll cover two interesting examples which will be useful to explain the full potential of Ruby

* **irb:** interactive ruby console.
* **Ruby One Liners**: small programs that are defined with a single line of code, they are executed using the command line Ruby, they are often used for file/directory manipulation or simple file system scripting.
  * Some examples are:
    * File spacing
    * Numbering and calculations
    * Text Conversion or Substitution

#### `cat` unix command in Ruby oneliner

```bash
$ ruby -pe 0 'file'
```

* `-e`: executes one line of ruby command.
* `-p`: iterates into a loop that reads each line and prints them to stdout.
* `-pe 0 'file'`: read 'file' line to line and prints then to stdout, executing 0 command. 

#### `wc` unix command in Ruby onliner

```bash
$ ruby -ne 'END {print "Lines:",$.,"\n"}' file
```

* `-e`: executes one line of Ruby code between single quotes.
* `-n`: puts the code into a loop.
* `print`: prints the following string to stdout without adding a new line at the end.
* `END`: executes the next block of instructions.
* `$.`: global variable that holds the last line number read by ruby interpreter.
* `.`: used to concatenate strings.

#### Replace substrings with Ruby oneliner

```bash
$ ruby -i.bak -pe 'gsub "foo","FOO"' file_name
```

* `-i`: specifies in-place edit mode, making a backup of the original file.
* `gsub`: global substitution.

### Libraries

> There are different sources of libraries, but the most uses is the packaging system [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org), which comes preinstalled with Ruby since version 1.9.

```bash
# Check documentation
gem help

# Search command used to look for gems
gem search <gem>

# Search for HTTP related remote gems
gem search -r http # -r: remote

# Search help options
gem search -h

# Help for install
gem install -h

# List your local installed gems
gem list
```

#### pry

The [pry](https://github.com/pry) library provides an interactive environment with many interesting features such as syntax highlighting.

```bash
gem install pry

# Use the prompt you prefer
pry --simple-prompt
```
