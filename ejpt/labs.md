## **Penetration Testing Prerequisites**

### **Introduction** → **HTTP\(S\) Traffic Sniffing**

#### **Analyze HTTP/HTTPS traffic using Wireshark**

The idea is to captura and analyze an HTTP and HTTPS login session and analyze a login session.

### Networking → Find the Secret Server

The goal of the lab is to configure your VPN lab environment in order to reach all the hosts in the networks \(172.16.88.0/24, 192.168.241.0/24\)

```bash
ip route add 192.168.222.0/24 via 10.175.34.1
```
