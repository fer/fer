# find

Most of the time, you wonâ€™t be looking for something in your working directory. The first argument of your `find` command should be the directory you want to search. The command will search in that directory and in all its subdirectories. So, if you want to search the whole filesystem, your command should begin with `find /`.

Two very useful flags are the `-type` and `-name` flags. With `-type`, you can use `d` to only find directories, and `f` to only find files. The `-name` flag is used to specify a name or pattern to look for. You can type the whole name, or use wildcards to specify only part\(s\) of the name. If you use wildcards, you need to enclose your pattern in quotes, otherwise the command won't work as intended. It is useful to know that you can also use the `-iname` flag; same as `-name`, but case insensitive.

## Find all files whose name ends with ".xml"

```text

```

## Find all files in the /home directory \(recursive\) whose name is "user.txt" \(case insensitive\)

```text
find /home -type f -iname user.txt
```

## Find all directories whose name contains the word "exploits"

```text
find / -type f -name *exploits*
```
