CAM
: Content Addressable Memory

DoS
: Denial of Service.

Egress Filtering
: Practice of monitoring and potentially restricting the flow of information outbound from one network to another. Typically it is information from a private TCP/IP computer network to the Internet that is controlled.

Packet
: Stream of bits running as electric signals on physical media used for data transmission (wire/LAN, WiFi). Every packet has *header* (ensures receiver can interpret payload and handle the communication) and a *payload* (with the actual information).

Privileges
: Identify actions a user is allowed to do.

Remote Code Execution
: Malicious user manages to execute some attacker-controlled code on a victim remote machine.

Security through Obscurity
: Secrecy of design to provide security.

ShellCode
: Piece of custom code which provides the attacker a shell on the victim machine.
